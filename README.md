# GettingCleaningData_CourseProject

This repo contains my Course Project materials for submission, including:

CodeBook.md = Code book describing variables, data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R = Code created to accomplish the following requirements for the Course Project:

			You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
			1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
			2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
			3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
			4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
			5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 					   activity and each subject.

dt_final.txt = This is the final data output resulting from the run_analysis.R code.

Note: As long as the raw data files have been moved into you working directory, run_analysis.R should complete as intended and yield the final tidy data set dt_final.txt
